# webradioreceiver
a python script to access and play web-based radio from specific stations

this serves only as a small scale prototype for a larger product and so it comes with some fundamental flaws, 
mainly the dependence on the streaming websites' structure, as any changes to the play button or URL would immediately break this script.
